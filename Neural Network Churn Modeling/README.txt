For this project, the task was to create a neural network model that tackled customer churn at a bank. 
The goal was to create a foundational neural network model that could be brought to deployment and used on real world
data to help the bank identify where intervention may be necessary to prevent customer ‘churn’ (Customers leaving the bank).

I used R for this project since that is my go-to programming language and ultimately with tis project I ended up concluding that while the model produced was quite valauble,
it was clear that in order to reach the defined goal above that I would need to complete an entire ensemble modeling process which I elected to save for another project!

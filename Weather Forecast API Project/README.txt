This was my very first attempt at a random forest model for one my in class projects. Unforunately,
about mid way through this process I discovered and concluded that my data would not be suitable for any 
kind of modeling given the nature of the variables. 

Regardless of the failure to create a viable model, I am extremely proud of this assignment as it was a great
challenge and honestly a good first attempt. Additionally, in this project I feel like I learned more than I 
have ever learned through my time as a data science student. I believe this project demonstrates solid 
documentation and code writing, a clear process, and ultimately a high degree of critical thinking and
problem solving skills as well as reasoning to arrive at the conclusions I arrived at.

This was a project/report that was interested in investigating suicde rate as a global phenomena using a classic UN dataset. The was one of the first assignments/reports that I have ever written so as result it was rather rudimentary from a techinical perspective,
however I think this assignment demonstrates my thought process through a complete EDA.

While EDA might not be considered the most technical/important skill for data work, I do firmly believe that having a good understanding and solid foundation of this skill makes for a better data scientist/analyst.
I think this project captures my thought process/critical thinking quite well and it demonstrates my ability to visual present information and elaborate on it.

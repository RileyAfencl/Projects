In this project I created a recommender system for movies!

The purpose of this project was to create a function that could intake a movie title and then print out a list of 10 movies that were similar or that the individual might enjoy based off of a given recommender dataset. 

This project was interesting in that it worked pretty actively with matrices and it was the first time I had ever interacted with different types of matrices as well. This was also my first encounter with a recommender system and I had no idea that these even existed 
at the time. This project was a bit difficult at first, but a main goal I had with this project was to really explain my process with Rmarkdown as best as I could.

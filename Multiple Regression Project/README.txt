For this project, the goal was figure out, from a dataset, which variables were the best predictors of the target variable Life Expectancy. 

In this project, I elected to run a multiple regression to answer this question and use the readout of the coefficients to see which variable was the most significant predict. 
While one of the more rudimentary projects that I have done, I think this project does a good job at showing how thorough my methodology can be. Additionally, I elected to do this entire project
in python as well to further show my capability of moving across languages. While R is my preferred, I am more than comfortable in a python environment.

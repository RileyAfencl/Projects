This is my write up for a k-means clustering model that I worked on. 

The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/customer-segmentation-clustering

For this project, my goal was to do a complete write-up and analysis on a K-means model. This project was based around the idea of coming up segmentation insights for a marketing team and providing them with data-driven conclusions.
Overall, I felt that this project was a resounding success in terms of my goal for starting it. I cannot overstate how much I actually learned doing this project, and how much more comfortable I am with clustering and interpreting those 
clusters in general. I also feel like I really did capture actionable insights for a marketing team with what I found in the data as well. 

A big focus in all of my projects moving forward is documentation. It might be a bit heavy at times, but my goal is not only to explain my code but also my thinking as well and why I make the decisions that I do. 
Rationalizing decisions is a huge part of datawork and I think it is a missed opportunity to not put your thought process on display! Even if it's wrong that is how we learn and improve!

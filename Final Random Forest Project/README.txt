This is a work through of building a random forest model from organic data. Beginning with data cleaning steps
and ending with the validation of a model, this details a step by step process that I used to create the model
produced in the code file. This model was highly accurate, well-tuned and justified. 

After failing to create a viable model the first time around I decided to go back and retrieve different data
so that I could complete a random forest model. Overall, I am quite happy with this project and I think the
model came out great and I learned a lot about data imputation. Further, I tried to put a heavy emphasis on
documentation to ensure that my code was readable and ultimately sharable with other people who would be 
interested. I do think it could have been a bit better and I will work on my documentation next time around!
